<h1>About the Book</h1>

<p>Punk Mathematics will be a series of mathematical stories. It is written
for readers who are interested in having their minds expanded by the strange
metaphors and implications of mathematics, even if theyâ€™re not always on
friendly terms with equations. Better living through probability; the
fractal dimension of cities and cancers; using orders of magnitude to detect
bullshit; free will and quantum economics; and the mathematics of
cooperation in a networked world on the brink of a No Future collapse.</p>
