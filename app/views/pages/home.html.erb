<h1>Punk Mathematics</h1>

<p>Punk Mathematics will be a series of mathematical stories.
It is written for readers who are interested in having their
minds expanded by the strange metaphors and implications of
mathematics, even if theyâ€™re not always on friendly terms
with equations. Better living through probability; the
fractal dimension of cities and cancers; using orders of
magnitude to detect bullshit; free will and quantum
economics; and the mathematics of cooperation in a networked
world on the brink of a No Future collapse.</p>

<p>As of <%= Time.now %>, it's still being written.</p>
